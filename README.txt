Display Scrabble Tournaments on WP pages with Vue.js using a single shortcode
This is a custom plugin and may not work on all WP installs as it requires several customisations, creation of several Custom Post Types and some additional plugins (Scrabble Tou CPT and PODS) to work. Scrabble Tou CPT is a custom plugin.
== Description ==

Display Scrabble Tournaments on WP pages with Vue.js using a single shortcode [tournaments_display]. Data is fetched through the WP REST API. This plugin Requires
three directories: 1. Player images/photo folder 2. Event photos 3. Json data files . These folders are created automatically on install of the accompanying plugin (Scrabble Tou CPT). The image folder should be manually populated with player's photo and named in this manner Firstname-Surname.jpg (e.g Bob-James.jpg). POD Custom Post Type (CPT) plugin is required to create 'Players', 'Tournaments' and 'Tournament-Details' CPT. Also a custom taxonomy'Tournament Categories' is required. Some data manipulation and calculations are done in the custom (accompanying) plugin. This plugin further analyse and displays the Scrabble tournament data and stats in a nice and pleasing (easy to navigate) manner

*   "Contributors" is a comma separated list of wp.org/wp-plugins.org usernames
*   "Tags" is a comma separated list of tags that apply to the plugin
*   "Requires at least" is the lowest version that the plugin will work on
*   "Tested up to" is the highest version that you've *successfully used to test the plugin*. Note that it might work on
higher versions... this is just the highest one you've verified.
*   Stable tag should indicate the Subversion "tag" of the latest stable version, or "trunk," if you use `/trunk/` for
stable.

    Note that the `readme.txt` of the stable tag is the one that is considered the defining one for the plugin, so
if the `/trunk/readme.txt` file says that the stable tag is `4.3`, then it is `/tags/4.3/readme.txt` that'll be used
for displaying information about the plugin.  In this situation, the only thing considered from the trunk `readme.txt`
is the stable tag pointer.  Thus, if you develop in trunk, you can update the trunk `readme.txt` to reflect changes in
your in-development version, without having that information incorrectly disclosed about the current stable version
that lacks those changes -- as long as the trunk's `readme.txt` points to the correct stable tag.

    If no stable tag is provided, it is assumed that trunk is stable, but you should specify "trunk" if that's where
you put the stable version, in order to eliminate any doubt.

the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets
directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png`
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).

Markdown uses email style notation for blockquotes and I've been told:
